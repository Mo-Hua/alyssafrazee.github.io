</p>      <p>This is the story of the day I went rogue and vowed from now until the end of time to manage my music collection without iTunes.</p>
<p>It was a breezy fall day weekday in Baltimore.  As was the case for the vast majority of fall weekdays, I was working on my computer in my (shared) office.  My office mates were doing the same.  All was peaceful until the sweet strains of a solo trumpet started playing on my laptop.  <em>Hey</em>, I thought to myself, <em>that sounds kind of familiar...Fanfare for the Common Man, yah?</em> And then a split second later I realized it was coming from <em>my</em> computer.  What?  I was working, in silence!</p>
<p>I hit the pause button on my keyboard, quit iTunes, and apologized to my office mates.  Luckily they're pretty chill, so they forgave me for the interruption.  We went on our merry ways, thinking it would be just another ordinary day.</p>
<p>But then, thirty seconds later, the previously-described scenario repeated itself almost exactly.  Fanfare for the Common Man began blaring, uninvited, through our office.  I was a little nonplussed, because I <em>specifically</em> remembered quitting iTunes thirty seconds earlier, but I muted my whole computer, quit iTunes (very intentionally/deliberately/definitively), apologized again to my officemates, and kept working...with one eye on the iTunes icon on my dock.</p>
<p>Five more seconds.  Same scenario.  This time I catch iTunes RED-HANDED!  I literally see the icon pop up in my dock, <em>unprompted</em>, and watch Fanfare for the Common Man begin to play (muted, this time). <em>Seriously?!</em> </p>
<p>At this point I decide to take a momentary break from work and fix my misbehaving iTunes, but googling the issue doesn't yield anything useful: most forum answers said something along the lines of "some other device or app is interacting with your iTunes software.  Disable it and you're good to go."  Okay, fine.  I check to make sure it's not my iPhone, my office mates' Macs, or an external app on my own machine, and I even peer into the offices next to mine to make sure nobody's using a universal Apple remote - I turn up nothing.  Fanfare for the Common Man does start playing again though.  </p>
<p>And that was my breaking point that fateful day.  I will play my music only when I want to play my music and not when my computer or some other device deems it the appropriate time.  I had also experienced a few other problems with the OSX version of iTunes - for example, sometimes songs I had purchased elsewhere took days to show up in my library after I added them, or playlists would be incompletely synced to my phone.  I could kind of deal with that stuff (though it wasn't ideal), but the fact that iTunes <em>would not stay closed</em> on its own volition was the last straw.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p>I went to my Applications folder and ran <code>sudo rm -rf iTunes.app</code> - it felt amazing.  </p>
<p>Apple tells its non-power-users that OSX <em>requires</em> iTunes.  This is pure poppycock, but it's the message you get if you try to delete the app from Finder or drag the dock icon to the trash.  So you've gotta go with <code>sudo rm</code>.  Playing around with <code>sudo rm</code> isn't really my jam, but I was really mad, and iTunes is re-installable from the app store, so it wasn't too risky of a move. </p>
<p>Ahhhhh, blissful silence.</p>
<p>And then I realized I didn't have a way to listen to music offline anymore.  I'd imagine it's how a boss would feel if they fired a really annoying employee in a fit of anger and then realized they really needed to fill that position immediately.  My two final candidates were <a href="https://play.google.com">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify Premium</a>, and I went with Google Play. So far, here are the parts I like and don't like:</p>
<p><strong>the good</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you can have a 20,000-song library in the cloud for free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gmusic-2-a-google-music-player/id708727021">third-party iPhone app</a> that I have really liked -- no more syncing!  If you have an Android phone, the mobile stuff is built right in (no extra work/configuration required)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the music manager lets you keep the music on your hard drive and Google Play library in sync pretty easily.  Everything goes both directions (so, should I get a new computer soon, I won't have to transfer all my music from hard-drive to hard-drive! I can just download the songs I want when I want them).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the bad</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>there is no "burn CD" function - when I wanted to burn an audio CD, the easiest way I found to do it involved re-downloading iTunes :'( However, perhaps this is the universe's way of reminding me that it's 2013 for crying out loud and so I shouldn't be burning CDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/articles-by-bn2b/1f546eded5c2">Google is pretty much on the verge of world domination</a> and I sometimes wish there were a part of my life that would still exist if Google's world domination plan went spectacularly awry one day and the whole company suddenly ceased to exist.  Currently my email, internet searching ability, document storage, navigation/GPS system, personal organization system, and (now) music would not exist in a world where Google didn't exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud music on the phone requires wifi or a cell network (and so can't be listened to on airplanes or in super rural areas - bummer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>automatic updates for Mac OS still tell you that you have iTunes updates, so if you don't uncheck them when you update your other software, you'll still have traces of iTunes on your machine :/ </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the bad stuff, I'm so much happier with Google Play than with iTunes, mostly because it <em>only plays music when I tell it to</em> which you'd think would be a basic principle of music-management software, but you'd apparently be wrong.</p>
