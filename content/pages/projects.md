### for my PhD

#### DER Finder
DER Finder, or "Differentially Expressed Region Finder," is a method for highlighting genomic regions that are significantly differentially expressed between populations based on results of an RNA-seq experiment.

-------------------------------------

#### Ballgown
In progress: a package for interactive differential expression analysis and visualization of transcriptomes that were assembled from RNA-seq data. 

--------------------------------

#### ReCount
We maintain a repository of information about publicly-available, research-quality RNA-seq datasets. For each experiment in the repository, ReCount includes gene-by-sample count tables, R [ExpressionSet](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/Biobase/inst/doc/ExpressionSetIntroduction.pdf) objects, and links to the raw data.

### side projects

#### CourseCat
Created at [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) with my friend [David](http://www.davidlichtenberg.com/), CourseCat is a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app to help people answer the question "What's a good online resource for learning about [TOPIC]?" Users can submit online courses (or other resources) and file them under topics. Courses can then be up- or down-voted by users based on whether or not they are good resources for each of their topics. On each topic page, courses are [smartly ranked](http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html) so that great courses for each topic appear at the top. The app is live and has full functionality, but it's still a work in progress, so the current courses and topics are placeholders.

#### Parsing Batch Job Runtimes from Emails
Python script that can scrape your Gmail account for a set of emails sent by the Sun Grid Engine scheduling system and analyze the runtimes and memory footprints of the jobs corresponding to that set of emails.

#### Random Calendar Generator
Python script that takes office hour slots + teaching assistants and their availabilities as input and randomly fills each office hour slot with a TA available at that time. It automatically creates a Google calendar for each TA and adds it to the master calendar using the Google Calendar API. My friend [Hilary initially implemented this project in R](http://hilaryparker.com/2013/01/14/random-calendar/); I converted it to Python in order to use the Google Calendar API and added the availability-checking. I wrote this while I was at [Hacker School](https://hackershool.com).

#### Committee Checker
[Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) app that checks the validity of a JHSPH exam committee, either for the preliminary oral exam or the final thesis defense.
