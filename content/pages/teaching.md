I'm the TA for John McGready's Coursera course, [Statistical Reasoning for Public Health](https://www.coursera.org/course/statreasoning).

#### in the past...
This past fall (2013), I was a lab instructor and lead TA for [Biostatistics 621-622](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/courses/bio622/) (Statistical Methods in Public Health I-II).  Before that, I was the lead TA for Biostatistics 611-612, Statistical Reasoning in Public Health I-II, for two years -- this is the Johns Hopkins on-campus version of the Coursera course mentioned above.  I won the [Helen Abbey Award](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/newsEvent/award/abbeyaward.shtml) for my work with that course in Fall 2011.  I was also a TA/statistical consultant for the [MPH program](http://www.jhsph.edu/academics/degree-programs/master-of-public-health/index.html) in both spring 2012 and spring 2013.
