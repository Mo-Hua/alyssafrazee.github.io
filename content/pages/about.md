Title: about

I am a PhD candidate in the [department of biostatistics](http://biostat.jhsph.edu) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://jhsph.edu). Here's my [CV](http://biostat.jhsph.edu/~afrazee/CV.pdf) and [publication list](publications.html).

For my dissertation, I'm developing statistical methods for detecting differential gene expression with RNA sequencing data.  I'm advised by [Jeff Leek](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~jleek/research.html) and I collaborate closely with the [Hopkins Genomics Working Group](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/genomics/). 

I spent the summer of 2013 writing [code](https://github.com/alyssafrazee) at [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) in New York City.
