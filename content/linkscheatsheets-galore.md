Title: links/cheatsheets galore

Here are some great pages I've found myself referring to a lot in the
past few weeks, or pages I want to remember (without bookmarking, since
I never look at my bookmarks).  I'm collecting them here so I can have a
somewhat reasonable number of tabs open in my browser at one time.
 (Things are getting insane at the moment).  They've helped me, so maybe
they'll help you too.

-   [Markdown basics][] - useful for writing README.md 's for github
    repos, among many other things: 
-   [Mac keyboard shortcut symbols][] - I never know what those crazy
    characters mean.  This is what they mean.
-   [Chrome keyboard shortcuts][] - I have now successfully been able to
    navigate between Sublime, Terminal, and two separate Chrome tabs
    without using my mouse.  AWESOME. (The above link is for Mac;
    [this][] is the link for Windows).
-   [A good git workflow][] - I haven't read this through but would
    really like to, since I need a more structured way of coding,
    committing, and pushing to github
-   [Homebrew][] - easy software installation for OS X!  yeah!  I
    finally got wget properly installed thanks to this magical world.
     And if something fails, you can start with "brew doctor" as a way
    to find the problem.  
-   I installed [Sublime Text 2][] the other day (a really
    beautiful/powerful text editor), and then I decided to try out
    [SublimeREPL][] for running code right there in Sublime.  I didn't
    want to lose the link to the SublimeREPL documentation, so it's
    here.  So far I think SublimeREPL is okay, but there are a few
    things I don't like, or maybe just haven't figured out yet: (1) I've
    had problems importing my libraries (i.e., if I'm in a folder with a
    script thelibrary.py, and I type import thelibrary.py, it complains
    that it can't find thelibrary).  (2) I haven't been able to ctrl-C
    or ctrl-D to escape functions while they're being evaluated.  (3)
    sometimes the syntax highlighting in the REPL is annoying - e.g.,
    there will be big strips of bright pink at the end of certain lines.
-   [An intro to HTTP][] - I'd love to read this soon, since I've
    started to do a bit of web development
-   [Flask mega tutorial][] - I'm working through this right now
-   [statuscode][] - news for programmers!

more to come!
