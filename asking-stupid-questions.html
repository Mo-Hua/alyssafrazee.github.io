</p>      <p>I learn best in environments that support a lot of question-asking. </p>
<p>I've been thinking about this recently because I've been reflecting on how detrimental fear </p>
<h3>bad reasons to not ask a question</h3>
<ul>
<li>"the person I'm asking might think I'm stupid, and will say that to my face and not answer my question."  If this actually happens after you ask your question, that person is a jerk and you probably didn't really want to learn with them anyway. </li>
<li>"the person I'm asking might think I'm stupid, but won't say that to my face and will answer my question anyway." In the <em>worst-case scenario</em> here, you'll look kinda silly in front of somebody for a little bit, but <em>you still get an answer to the question</em>. In my experience, taking an ego bruise but still learning is ALWAYS a better choice than not learning.</li>
<li>"I can probably figure this out on my own (with several hours of research)." When this thought stops me from asking a question, my pride has gotten the best of me. Having a 10-minute conversation with somebody who knows about the topic will probably save me SEVERAL HOURS OF TIME because they can immediately explain only the confusing parts -- I don't have to wade through documentation, introductory essays, etc. If they're willing to give you those 10 minutes (or even 10 seconds! they can give you a resource recommendation!), absolutely do it. </li>
</ul>
<h3>good reasons not to ask a question</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I can probably figure this out on my own with a quick Google search." Excellent. </li>
<li>
<p>"There's a room full of people here, and my question is likely irrelevant to the majority of them." This happens a lot at talks. In this case, the ideal solution is to ask your question to the speaker on-on-one afterward. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>answerable: it's not an open research problem. The person being asked this question will likely know the answer immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>basic: it reveals that the asker is still learning about the foundational concepts of the topic</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h3>externally</h3>
<h3>internally</h3>
<h4>(1) be egoless</h4>
<p>Realize that you're asking the question in order to learn something, not in order to impress anyone. Here's my story about this: every week at Hacker School ends with presentations: anybody can sign up for a 2- or 5-minute block of time to talk about a project or concept or tutorial or whatever. My thought process during presentations usually went something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>that person's project is really cool</li>
<li>I wonder how she came up with that idea?</li>
<li>wait what, he made that in Python?! I didn't know Python could do that thing. That's awesome! I want to make Python do that thing.</li>
<li>[thoughts about how to make Python do the thing]</li>
<li>I have literally no idea where to start with making Python do that thing</li>
<li>but the <em>presenter</em> knows where to start...she'd probably talk to me about it if I asked. We could get coffee tomorrow!</li>
<li>but holy crap, I know <em>so little</em> about this. My questions will be at a beginner level. There are some major concepts I don't understand yet. He might laugh at me, or secretly think I'm stupid</li>
<li>...but I would rather learn to do that Python thing (even if it means looking kind of silly) than not learn the thing and save face</li>
<li>RESOLVED! I will approach this person tomorrow and ask her about the project! </li>
</ul>
<p>The "egoless" part enters in the second-to-last step in that process: deciding that I cared more about learning something new than I did about whether or not the other person would think I was stupid -- which would only happen in the <em>worst case scenario</em> anyway: most good collaborators don't laugh or scoff at a genuine desire to learn.</p>
<h4>(2) be confident</h4>
<p>It's a lot easier to ask a stupid question when you <em>know you are not stupid</em>. </p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about the following things over the past few months: fear, ego, impostor syndrome, arrogance, confidence, teachability, and resilience.  I basically spent 2013 doing a lot of unstructured learning (at PhD school and also at Hacker School), and </p>
<p>I started thinking about all of this because  </p>
