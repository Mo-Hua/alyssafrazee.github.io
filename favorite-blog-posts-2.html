</p>      <p>Here's part 2 in my series on fantastic blog posts written by other people! <a href="http://alyssafrazee.com/favorite-blog-posts.html">See part 1</a> for more favorites.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/">Peter Seibel proposes an approach to code reading</a> that doesn't treat pieces of code like literature. Some people make the following argument: you would <em>never</em> meet a novelist - a writer of novels - that didn't read novels. Nor should we ever meet programmers - writers of code - who <em>never read code</em>. The problem with this argument, though, is that novels are written <em>in order to be read by humans</em>. Computer programs are written to make a computer do a thing. So to learn from other people's code, we shouldn't <em>read</em> it - we should <em>decode</em> it. We should act like naturalists and treat the code like specimens.  I think studying/decoding something takes a lot more time and mental energy than reading something, but it makes total sense that this approach would make it easier/less frustrating to learn from other people's code.</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2012/10/30/on-weather-forecasts-nate-silver-and-the/">Jeff Leek's post explaining what Nate Silver meant</a> when he wrote that Obama had a 75% chance of winning the 2012 election, based on a giant analysis of lots of poll data. Jeff illustrates important statistical concepts (like variability) with a simple simulation. This post is written for a general audience (not an audience consisting only of statisticians). I wish more people wrote posts about scientific/technical/statistical concepts for general audiences, since these concepts pop up in big, culturally-important news stories from time to time. Also, fun fact, this post isn't recent (it's from October 30, 2012 - just days before the election!), but I read it recently, so it makes the list.</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://maryrosecook.com/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming">Mary Rose Cook's introduction to functional programming</a> this week, and I <em>finally</em> understand what functional programming is! I was so excited! The line in the post that did it for me: "Ignore all that. Functional code is characterised by one thing: the absence of side effects." Now I can legitimately laugh at <a href="https://xkcd.com/1312/">this XKCD</a>. I also now know that most of the code I write is not in a very "functional" style: production of a plot is a side effect. Changing data is a side effect. The post is quite detailed and technical, but it's <em>very</em> good. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really enjoyed <a href="http://sdawncasey.wordpress.com/about/">S. Dawn Casey's post</a> about starting the journey toward being a software developer. She writes: "I can write little scripts that do stupid things, but I can't figure out how exactly this makes the internet work. At all." I felt <em>exactly this feeling</em> right around week 2 of Hacker School, when I could write games and functions and scripts all day long but didn't really know how to make a usable piece of software. I loved reading about someone else's experiences with that learning process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/02/15/how-was-hacker-school/">Julia Evans perfectly describes what Hacker School is like</a> in this post. She did such a great job capturing the essence of Hacker School. The post isn't overly long, but it contains exactly the right amount of detail: it identifies at least 10 qualities that make Hacker School magical. Read the post. It's so good. </p>

<p>Did you ever want to make all the pages on your internet be cats? Now you can! Monica <a href="http://notwaldorf.github.io/posts/go-cat-dns-go/">made a DNS server that exclusively serves cat pictures</a>.  I'm really really starting to love reading posts along the lines of "I didn't understand this Thing one day. I felt bad about this so I read the internetz, but then I got confused about A, B, and C." The end. It's also fun if the post continues thusly: "I wrote some totally non-functional code and got super frustrated, but THEN I figured out how to solve A, partially address B, and work around C. Now I have a much better understanding of Thing. Here is a hilarious project demonstrating said understanding!" Monica's post is totally like this. It's about a project she did to understand DNS servers better.  Also the URL at the end of the post is "go cat DNS go" which is way awesome. </p>

<p>I really liked <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">Roger Dudler's beautiful, simple introduction to git</a>. It covers everything you need to know to get started, with the possible exception of undoing a commit / resetting the repo to a specific commit. (I'm thinking of git reset and rebase). There's even a pretty pdf you can download for reference! Super great. </p>
