</p>      <p>Let me tell you a silly story.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I was sitting in my shared office, doing one of the various and sundry research-related tasks I tend to do while in my office.  All was quiet, peaceful, and productive.  But then!  We heard a quiet sound.  A sweet, solo trumpet.  <em>Where is that coming from?</em>, I wondered silently.  <em>It sounds familiar...Fanfare for the Common Man, yah?</em>  And then a second later I realized it was coming from <em>my</em> computer.  What?  I was silently, peacefully computer-ing, and hadn't turned on music because I didn't have my headphones that day.  Weird. I hit my keyboard's pause button, quit iTunes, and apologized to my office mates.  Luckily they're pretty chill, so they forgave me and went on our merry researching ways, thinking it would be just another ordinary day.</p>
<p>But then, thirty seconds later, the previously-described scenario repeated itself almost exactly.  Fanfare for the Common Man began blaring, uninvited, through our office.  I was a little nonplussed, because I <em>specifically</em> remembered quitting iTunes thirty seconds earlier, but okay, sometimes I make mistakes or hit the wrong buttons or do other things that humans do.  Things happen.  I apologized again, muted my whole computer, quit iTunes (very intentionally/deliberately/definitively), and kept working...with one eye on the iTunes icon on my dock.</p>
<p>Five more seconds.  Same scenario.  This time I catch iTunes RED-HANDED!  I literally see the icon pop up in my dock, <em>unprompted</em>, and watch Fanfare for the Common Man begin to play (muted, this time). <em>Seriously?!</em> </p>
<p>At this point I decide to take a momentary break from work and fix my misbehaving iTunes, but googling the issue doesn't yield anything useful: most forum answers said something along the lines of "some other device or app is interacting with your iTunes software.  Disable it and you're good to go."  Okay, fine.  I check to make sure it's not my iPhone, my office mates' Macs, or an external app on my own machine, and I even peer into the offices next to mine to make sure nobody's using a universal Apple remote - nothing turns up.  Fanfare for the Common Man does start playing again though.  </p>
<p>And that was my breaking point that fateful day.  I will play my music only when I want to play my music and not when my computer or some other device deems it the appropriate time.  This was not the first problem I had experienced with the OSX version of iTunes, either: sometimes songs I had purchased elsewhere took days to show up in my library after I added them, or playlists would be incompletely synced to my phone.  I could kind of deal with that stuff (though it wasn't ideal), but the fact that iTunes <em>would not stay closed</em> on its own volition was the last straw.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p>iTunes had just lost its status of "usable software" in my book, so I decided to delete it.  (GASP!)  I dragged the icon to the trash, only to discover that Apple tells rogue iTunes-deleters like me that OSX <em>requires</em> iTunes.  This is pure poppycock.  I had to bring out the big guns: <code>sudo rm</code>, which is basically a command that gives you root access to delete anything you want on your machine.  Playing around with <code>sudo rm</code> is not really my jam, and shouldn't really be your jam either, because its effects are basically irreversible, but I was feeling really wild that day (plus iTunes is always re-installable from the app store), so I went to my Applications folder and ran <code>sudo rm -rf iTunes.app</code>.  Then I experienced one sweet moment of relief.  </p>
<p>A minute later, I realized I didn't have a way to listen to music offline anymore.  I'd imagine it's how a boss would feel if they fired a really annoying employee in a fit of anger and then realized they actually needed somebody to do that job.  </p>
<p>But in the past year or so, in my process of (hopefully) becoming a better researcher and better programmer, I've slooowly started to realize something: there are people and companies and institutions all over the place whose main objective is to develop high-quality tools.  Sometimes they're free and open-source and sometimes they're not, but <strong>if you're using a tool that's broken, chances are that somebody somewhere has made and released something better</strong>.  It might take some time and some pretty serious searching to find it, but then again, it might be the first search result.  <strong>The fact that something is the current default does not mean its quality is high</strong> and if it's actively making your life worse, stop using it.  Stop putting up with it just because it's there, or because everybody else puts up with it.  <em>There is probably something better</em>.  And (this is the fun/hard part): if there isn't something better, maybe I can <em>make</em> something better.  The ability have/believe this thought ("maybe I can make something better") has been a really cool part of learning to do research and learning to program: both those endeavors involve learning to <em>solve unsolved problems</em>.</p>
<p>If there isn't something better out there, and making something better is a huge committment requiring skills or money or time you don't have, it STILL might be better to quit using the broken thing.  Maybe there's a workaround, or maybe if tons of people quit using the broken thing, that thing will get fixed, or replaced by someone that <em>does</em> have the skills/time/money to make something better. </p>
<p>Getting a music manager that was better than iTunes turned out to be <em>easy</em>: I switched over to <a href="https://play.google.com">Google Play</a> and a great <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gmusic-2-a-google-music-player/id708727021">third-party iPhone app</a>.  The fact that the conflict in my silly story had such a simple resolution actually made me think a lot about my complacency with the tools I use: why had I put up with mildly annoying iTunes bugs for YEARS when I could have started using something better in SECONDS?  Why had I not switched my key-repeat button to "fast" earlier?  When I had a Windows machine, why was I using the terrifyingly awful built-in R IDE?  All those things boil down to complacency - being able to put up with mildly annoying things when.  It's taken me years to become less okay with these broken things, but it's happening.  Slowly.</p>
<p>I'm using the phrase "broken things" in this post to refer mostly to less-than-ideal software that people just roll with because it's the default, but complacency and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias">status quo bias</a> become pretty serious problems when "broken things" refers to systemic social problems.  One more huge reason to be conscious about complacency in little things: maybe, hopefully, we'll figure out how to recognize it when it appears in bigger ways. </p>
