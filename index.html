  <p>Hey, I'm Alyssa! I work on machine learning at <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> in San Francisco.</p>

  <p>Before joining Stripe, I did a PhD in biostatistics at <a href="http://biostat.jhsph.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a> with <a href="http://jtleek.com/">Jeff Leek</a>. My research focused on computational biology, specifically developing statistical methods and software for finding differential gene expression with RNA sequencing data. A lot of my graduate work is publicly available, including <a href="{{site.url}}/writing">papers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/alyssafrazee">R packages</a>, and <a href="{{site.url}}/talks">talks</a>.</p>

  <p>I spent the summer after my 3rd year of grad school (2013) at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> in New York City and loved it. Before grad school I studied math at <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/">St. Olaf College</a> in Minnesota.</p>

  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/acfrazee">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssa-frazee-9aa9a095/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/alyssafrazee/">GitHub</a>, or possibly riding my bike around the Bay Area or the <a href="https://www.cascade.org/rides-major-rides/kaiser-permanente-stp-presented-alaska-airlines">Pacific Northwest</a>.
